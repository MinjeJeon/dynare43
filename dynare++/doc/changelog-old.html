<TD>1.3.7
<TD>2008/01/15
<TD>

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Corrected a serious bug in centralizing a
decision rule. This bug implies that all results based on simulations
of the decision rule were wrong. However results based on stochastic
fix points were correct. Thanks to Wouter J. den Haan and Joris de Wind!

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Added options --centralize and --no-centralize.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Corrected an error of a wrong
variance-covariance matrix in real-time simulations (thanks to Pawel
Zabzcyk).

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Corrected a bug of integer overflow in refined
faa Di Bruno formula if one of refinements is empty. This bug appeared
when solving models without forward looking variables.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Corrected a bug in the Sylvester equation
formerly working only for models with forward looking variables.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Corrected a bug in global check printout.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Added generating a dump file.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Fixed a bug of forgetting repeated assignments
(for example in parameter settings and initval).

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Added a diff operator to the parser.

<TR>
<TD>1539
<TD>1.3.6
<TD>2008/01/03
<TD>

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Corrected a bug of segmentation faults for long
names and path names. 

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Changed a way how random numbers are
generated. Dynare++ uses a separate instance of Mersenne twister for
each simulation, this corrects a flaw of additional randomness caused
by operating system scheduler. This also corrects a strange behaviour
of random generator on Windows, where each simulation was getting the
same sequence of random numbers.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Added calculation of conditional distributions
controlled by --condper and --condsim.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Dropped creating unfoled version of decision
rule at the end. This might consume a lot of memory. However,
simulations might be slower for some models.

<TR>
<TD>1368
<TD>1.3.5
<TD>2007/07/11
<TD>

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Corrected a bug of useless storing all derivative
indices in a parser. This consumed a lot of memory for large models.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Added an option <tt>--ss-tol</tt> controlling a
tolerance used for convergence of a non-linear solver.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Corrected buggy interaction of optimal policy
and forward looking variables with more than one period.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Variance matrices can be positive
semidefinite. This corrects a bug of throwing an error if estimating
approximation errors on ellipse of the state space with a
deterministic variable.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD> Implemented simulations with statistics
calculated in real-time. Options <tt>--rtsim</tt> and <tt>--rtper</tt>.

<TR>
<TD>1282
<TD>1.3.4
<TD>2007/05/15
<TD>

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Corrected a bug of wrong representation of NaN in generated M-files.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Corrected a bug of occassionaly wrong evaluation of higher order derivatives of integer powers.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Implemented automatic handling of terms involving multiple leads.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Corrected a bug in the numerical integration, i.e. checking of the precision of the solution.

<TR>
<TD>1090
<TD>1.3.3
<TD>2006/11/20
<TD>

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Corrected a bug of non-registering an auxiliary variable in initval assignments.

<TD>988
<TD>1.3.2
<TD>2006/10/11
<TD>

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Corrected a few not-serious bugs: segfault on
some exception, error in parsing large files, error in parsing
matrices with comments, a bug in dynare_simul.m

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Added posibility to specify a list of shocks for
which IRFs are calculated

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Added --order command line switch

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Added writing two MATLAB files for steady state
calcs

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Implemented optimal policy using keyword
planner_objective and planner_discount

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Implemented an R interface to Dynare++ algorithms
(Tamas Papp)

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Highlevel code reengineered to allow for
different model inputs

<TR>
<TD>799
<TD>1.3.1
<TD>2006/06/13
<TD>

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Corrected few bugs: in error functions, in linear algebra module.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Updated dynare_simul.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Updated the tutorial.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Corrected an error in summing up tensors where
setting up the decision rule derivatives. Thanks to Michel
Juillard. The previous version was making deterministic effects of
future volatility smaller than they should be.

<TR>
<TD>766
<TD>1.3.0
<TD>2006/05/22
<TD>

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>The non-linear solver replaced with a new one.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>The parser and derivator replaced with a new
code. Now it is possible to put expressions in parameters and initval
sections.

<TD>436
<TD>1.2.1
<TD>2005/08/17
<TD>

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Faa Di Bruno for sparse matrices optimized. The
implementation now accommodates vertical refinement of function stack
in order to fit a corresponding slice to available memory. In
addition, zero slices are identified. For some problems, this implies
significant speedup.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Analytic derivator speedup.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Corrected a bug in the threading code. The bug
stayed concealed in Linux 2.4.* kernels, and exhibited in Linux 2.6.*,
which has a different scheduling. This correction also allows using
detached threads on Windows.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Added MATLAB interface, which allows simulation
of a decision rule in MATLAB.

<TR><TD><TD><TD> <TD>Got rid of Matrix Template Library.

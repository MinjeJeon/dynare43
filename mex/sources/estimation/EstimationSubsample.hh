 * and end periods:

 * It defines start and end of that period.which has start higher/equal than any
 * individual parameter start and its end lower|equal than any individual
 * parameter end in that perod window.) integrated xparam1 and priors for that
 * period
 *
 * All those EstPeriod-s need to be constructed at some point once at a start of
 * estimation  by EstPeriod costructor  from the information such as invidual
 * parameter start-end periods and the relevant associated priors for those
 * periods. That initial info-set is held in the vector of vectors of
 * EstParamSubSampleDescription
 *
 * it constructs and contains indices of all estimated xparam1 parameters valid
 * for this period in the larger, extended xparam1x vector passed  in.  from the
 * gradient function.
 *
 * The EstimatedParametersDescription. structure (or class with protected
 * elements) integrates all that information and makes it available to (friend ?)
 * class LogPosteriorDensity on as needed basis and updates all parameters (inc. H
 * and Q) when time slot xparam1 is supplied.
 *
 * Time indices follow C convention: first period has index 0.
